Current roadmap
---------------

In addition to the point release milestones currently established, our current
roadmap priorities also include:

Admin UX
    https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/milestone/16

Search Improvements
    https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/milestone/23

YAML File Completion
    https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/milestone/28

There are also several milestones that are explicitly *not* a priority for the
core team:

Cleanup
    https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/milestone/10

Refactoring
    https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/milestone/34

Core team will not be focusing their time on these milestones in development.
